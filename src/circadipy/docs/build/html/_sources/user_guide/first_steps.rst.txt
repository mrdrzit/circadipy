*This is a tool for analyzing and visualizing circadian cycle data*


First steps
-----------

You will need at least python 3.8 to run circadipy. We **strongly** recommend installing
python using an open-source package and environment management system such as miniconda or mamba.
Whith either of these, you can create a new environment with the required dependencies that will
contain all the packages you need to run circadipy.

If you want to follow down this road, the steps are as follows:

    #. Miniconda or mamba installation
    #. Environment creation using the provided circadipy_env.yml file
    #. Package installation

Refer to the :doc:`Package manager section<package_manager>` for more information on how to setup mambaforge on your computer!
